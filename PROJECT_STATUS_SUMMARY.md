# Project Handoff & Final Status Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project's current state, including its architecture, required services, completed features, and next steps. **The backend is now complete and ready for frontend integration.**

---

## Part 1: System Architecture

The application has been architected as a modern, scalable web service with a decoupled frontend, following a "hybrid approach" that separates the core AI logic from the web-serving layer.

### 1.1. Backend Architecture

The backend is composed of two main parts: the `api_server` and the core `guild` package.

*   **`api_server` (FastAPI Application):**
    *   **Framework:** Built with **FastAPI** for high-performance, asynchronous request handling.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Exposes all system functionality through a RESTful API. It handles user requests, database interactions, and dispatching tasks to the background worker.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `main.py`: The entry point for the FastAPI application.
        *   `routes/`: Contains the API endpoints, logically separated by function (e.g., `workflows.py`, `onboarding.py`).
        *   `models.py`: Defines the **SQLAlchemy** database models for all persistent data (Contracts, Workflows, AgentExecutions).
        *   `database.py`: Manages the database connection and session creation.

*   **`guild` (Core Logic Package):**
    *   **Framework:** A standard Python package, installable via `pip`.
    *   **Responsibilities:** Contains all the "brains" of the operation. This includes the agent definitions, the orchestrator logic, LLM clients, and other core business logic. It is designed to be independent and potentially reusable.
    *   **Key Components:**
        *   `agents/`: Contains the implementation for all **29+ specialist AI agents** across 8 categories. Each agent is a class with enhanced prompts and specialized capabilities.
        *   `core/orchestrator.py`: The **Intelligent Orchestrator**. This is the central component that analyzes user requests and dynamically creates a multi-agent execution plan (DAG).
        *   `core/llm_client.py`: An abstracted client for interacting with Large Language Models.
        *   `core/config.py`: Manages all application settings and API keys.
        *   `core/markitdown_processor.py`: Handles non-LLM-ready document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
        *   `core/scraping/`: Advanced web scraping with Scrapy framework.
        *   `core/data_enrichment.py`: Lead validation and data enhancement.
        *   `core/automation/`: Visual and web automation capabilities.

*   **Task Queuing (Celery & Redis):**
    *   **Framework:** **Celery** is used to manage long-running background tasks, specifically the execution of AI agent workflows.
    *   **Broker:** **Redis** serves as the message broker for Celery, managing the queue of tasks to be executed.
    *   **Benefit:** This ensures the API remains fast and responsive. When a user approves a workflow, the API immediately returns a confirmation while the work is handed off to a Celery worker.

### 1.2. Frontend Architecture

*   **Framework:** Built with **React** and bootstrapped with **Vite** for a fast development experience.
*   **Responsibilities:** Provides the full user interface for interacting with the AI workforce.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `App.jsx`: The main component that handles top-level state, including the logic to show the onboarding flow or the main application.
    *   `components/OnboardingFlow.jsx`: A dedicated, conversational UI for the one-time user setup process.
    *   `components/MarketingCampaignCreator.jsx`: The primary interface for creating new campaigns. It manages the three-step process of **Input**, **Approval**, and **Monitoring**.
    *   **UI Library:** Uses **`shadcn/ui`** for a clean, modern, and accessible component library.
    *   **Visualization:** Uses **`react-flow`** to render the workflow DAG, providing users with a clear visual representation of the AI's plan and its real-time execution status.

## Part 2: Required Services & Connections

To run the application in its entirety, the following services and connections must be configured and running.

*   **Primary Database:**
    *   **Service:** **PostgreSQL**
    *   **Purpose:** The main relational database for storing all persistent data (contracts, workflows, user info, etc.).
    *   **Configuration:** The connection string is set via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

*   **Task Queue Broker:**
    *   **Service:** **Redis**
    *   **Purpose:** Manages the queue of background tasks for Celery.
    *   **Configuration:** Celery is configured to connect to a Redis instance.

*   **Vector Database (for RAG/Memory):**
    *   **Service:** **Qdrant**
    *   **Purpose:** Stores vector embeddings of documents, enabling semantic search and providing long-term memory for the agents.
    *   **Configuration:** The connection is managed within the `guild` package.

*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
    *   **Service 1 (Local):** **Ollama**
    *   **Purpose:** Allows for running open-source models (like Llama 3) locally for development, testing, or privacy-focused deployments.
    *   **Configuration:** The `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable points to the Ollama server.
    *   **Service 2 (Cloud):** **Together.ai**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides access to high-performance cloud-based LLMs (like Llama-3-70B).
    *   **Configuration:** Requires a `TOGETHER_API_KEY` environment variable.

*   **External API Connections:**
    *   **Service:** **Zapier**
    *   **Purpose:** The system can push final results to a Zapier webhook, allowing for integration with thousands of other applications.
    *   **Configuration:** The `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` (note: variable name is a remnant of a previous iteration, but points to Zapier) environment variable holds the webhook URL.
