# Project Status Summary & Next Steps

This document provides a living summary of the project's current state and a clear proposal for the next steps. It will be updated as we complete major phases of work.

### Part 1: Current Project Status (What We've Built)

The project is a functional, end-to-end system with a sophisticated architecture and a strong foundation of AI capabilities.

**1. The Modern Architecture:**
*   **Core `guild` Package:** An independent, reusable Python package containing all core logic.
*   **FastAPI `api_server`:** A high-performance web server exposing the system's capabilities.
*   **Decoupled `frontend`:** A React-based UI for user interaction.

**2. Key Systems & Capabilities:**
*   **Database Persistence:** PostgreSQL for storing all workflows, contracts, and agent execution steps.
*   **Scalable Task Queuing:** Celery and Redis for managing long-running AI tasks.
*   **Abstracted LLM Client:** Flexible client for multiple LLM providers (Ollama, Together.ai).
*   **RAG Pipeline (Memory):** Qdrant and LangChain for ingesting documents and providing context to agents.
*   **Real-World Automation:** Zapier webhook integration for triggering external actions.

**3. Intelligent Agent Workforce (The "Workers"):**
*   **Knowledge-Injected Agents:** All agents are enhanced with real-time web search results.
*   **Intelligent Orchestrator:** The Orchestrator agent analyzes user requests and autonomously creates a multi-agent execution plan (DAG).
*   **Implemented Agent Suites:** We have implemented two full "departments" of world-class agents:

    *   **AI Marketing Department:**
        *   `ContentStrategist`: Plans holistic content calendars.
        *   `SEOAgent`: Provides expert-level SEO analysis.
        *   `PaidAdsAgent`: Manages and optimizes paid advertising campaigns.
        *   `Copywriter`: Generates compelling copy based on strategy.
        *   `JudgeAgent`: Ensures quality control for all deliverables.

    *   **AI Sales & Operations Department:**
        *   `SalesFunnelAgent`: Designs high-converting sales funnels.
        *   `CRMAgent`: Sets up CRM and marketing automation workflows.
        *   `ProjectManagerAgent`: Breaks down high-level goals into detailed project plans.
        *   `HRAgent`: Streamlines hiring by creating job descriptions and interview plans.

**4. User-Facing Features:**
*   **Context-Rich UI:** The frontend captures detailed user objectives and audience information.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Control:** The system generates a plan and waits for user approval before execution.
*   **Transparency View:** A `react-flow` based view visualizes the AI's plan and real-time execution status.

### Part 2: What's Next (The Implementation Roadmap)

The foundational Marketing, Sales, and Operations departments are now established. The next phase is to build out the remaining specialized agents from your comprehensive plan to create a truly complete "Company in a Box".

Here is the proposed implementation plan for the remaining agents, grouped by department:

**1. Implement the Executive Layer:**
*   **Agents:** `Chief of Staff`, `Strategy`, `Strategic Sounding Board`, `Well-being & Workload Optimization`, `Accountability & Motivation Coach`.
*   **Why:** This will provide the highest level of strategic coordination, decision support, and personal management for the solo-founder, acting as a virtual executive team.

**2. Complete the Marketing & Growth Department:**
*   **Agents:** `PR/Outreach`, `Community Manager`.
*   **Why:** To round out the marketing capabilities with earned media and community-building functions.

**3. Complete the Sales & Revenue Department:**
*   **Agents:** `Outbound Sales`, `Partnerships`.
*   **Why:** To add proactive lead generation and strategic growth channels beyond inbound marketing.

**4. Complete the Operations Department:**
*   **Agents:** `Training`, `Compliance`, `Skill Development`, `Outsourcing & Freelancer Management`.
*   **Why:** To build out the critical internal systems for scalability, knowledge management, and delegation.

**5. Implement the Finance Department:**
*   **Agents:** `Bookkeeping`, `Investor Relations`, `Pricing`.
*   **Why:** To provide a comprehensive suite of tools for managing the financial health and strategy of the business.

**6. Implement the Product & Customer Department:**
*   **Agents:** `Product Manager`, `Customer Support`, `UX/UI Tester`, `Churn Predictor`.
*   **Why:** To create a robust system for managing the product lifecycle, from feature prioritization to customer support and retention.

This roadmap outlines the path to completing the full vision of the agentic AI software. We can tackle these departments in the order you see fit.
