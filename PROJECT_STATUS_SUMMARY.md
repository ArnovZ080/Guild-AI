# Project Status Summary

This document provides a rundown of the project's current state after the major architectural refactoring and the implementation of the foundational AI features.

## What is the state of the project now?

The project is now a **fully functional, end-to-end application with a real backend**. The refactoring established a robust architecture, and the subsequent steps implemented the core mechanics. It is no longer just "logic"; it's a complete, working system ready for the AI logic to be enhanced.

Hereâ€™s what the system currently entails:

1.  **A Real, High-Performance Backend:**
    *   We have a working **FastAPI web server** (the `api_server`). This is a real backend that can handle API requests, manage data, and run jobs.
    *   It is connected to a **PostgreSQL database**, so all data (like tasks and workflows) is saved persistently.

2.  **A Core "Brains" Package (`guild`):**
    *   This is the heart of the application, containing all the core business logic for agents, tools, and orchestration. It's designed to be completely independent of the web server.
    *   It has a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**, so you can interact with the system directly from your terminal.

3.  **An End-to-End Workflow:**
    *   You can make an API call to create a new task (an `OutcomeContract`).
    *   The system will automatically use the **Judge Agent** to generate a quality-control rubric for that task.
    *   It then uses the **Orchestrator** to create a step-by-step plan (a DAG).
    *   It executes this plan in the background, calling the **Research Agent** to perform a real web search and gather information.
    *   The system can store and retrieve information from a **Qdrant vector database**, meaning the foundational **RAG pipeline** is in place.

## Is it connected to an LLM service?

You are exactly right to ask this. The system is **perfectly designed and ready for LLM integration**, but we have not taken that final step yet.

*   **How it Works Now:** The agents I built (Judge, Research) are currently "rule-based." They use standard Python code (`if/else` statements, web scraping libraries) to make decisions and perform tasks. This was done to build the "skeleton" of the system first.

*   **The Next Step (Connecting an LLM):** The system is set up to be connected to an LLM service like OpenAI. We already have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` in our configuration. The next logical step is to upgrade the agents. For example, instead of the rule-based `generate_rubric` function in the Judge Agent, we would replace it with a call to an LLM, giving it a prompt like: *"Here is a user's objective: '{objective}'. Generate a detailed quality rubric for this task."*

**In summary: The entire backend, database, and agent workflow is built and functional. The final, and most exciting, step is to start replacing the simple rule-based agent logic with calls to a powerful LLM to bring them to life.**
