## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 Release Notes

This is the first stable release of the Hybrid Storage Workflow System. The system provides a comprehensive platform for orchestrating AI agents with connected data sources to automate content creation workflows.

#### Key Highlights

**Multi-Provider Data Integration**: Connect and sync data from various sources including Google Drive, Notion, OneDrive, Dropbox, and local workspace storage. The hybrid architecture ensures flexibility and scalability.

**AI Agent Orchestration**: Leverage specialized AI agents for different aspects of content creation, from research and writing to fact-checking and quality assurance. The system implements a robust evaluation framework to ensure high-quality outputs.

**Workflow Automation**: Define outcome contracts with specific objectives, deliverables, and quality criteria. The system compiles these into executable workflows with real-time monitoring and control.

**Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive API documentation, SDK examples, and deployment guides make it easy to integrate and extend the system. Docker containerization ensures consistent deployment across environments.

#### Breaking Changes

None - this is the initial stable release.

#### Migration Guide

For users upgrading from beta versions (0.9.x), please refer to the [Migration Guide](docs/migration.md) for detailed instructions on updating your configuration and data.

#### Known Issues

- OAuth token refresh may occasionally fail for Notion integrations (workaround: re-authenticate)
- Large file uploads (>100MB) may timeout in some configurations (increase timeout settings)
- Workflow execution may be slower for complex DAGs with many dependencies (optimization planned for v1.1.0)

#### Deprecation Notices

None for this release.
