- **Tone:** (e.g., Formal vs. Casual, Humorous vs. Serious, Scientific vs. Enthusiastic)
- **Vocabulary:** (e.g., Simple & Accessible vs. Industry Jargon & Expert-level)
- **Pacing:** (e.g., Short & Punchy vs. Detailed & Explanatory)
- **Personality:** (e.g., "If your brand was a person, who would it be? A wise mentor, a quirky friend, a trusted authority?")
